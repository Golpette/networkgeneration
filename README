Two programs to generate biochemically feasible reactions from EC numbers: 
/networkgeneration_steve and /networkgeneration_bartek

/analysis takes network produced by networkgeneration_bartek and contains programs for enumerating and 
comparing alternative pathways


"_bartek" program automatically calculates Delta-G values via a group contribution method, 
trained on experimental Delta-G values from Alberty's database.  

"_steven" currently does not implement any thermodynamics.  
See separate readme files in each directory for more details, and the "Notes on ... reactions.odt" files 
for some notes and references on each of the reaction classes included in the networks and how they are implemented.
