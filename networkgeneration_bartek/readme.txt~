Reaction network generation in C++.   Bartek Waclaw 2014.

Network generation program is contained in "enum_reactions_v3_2_2.cpp". This 
generates all compounds and reactions between them, along with the standard 
free energy change under the specified conditions (currently T=25 C, pH=7, I=0.2 M).

How to compile:    g++ -o enum_rxns enum_reactions_v3_2_2.cpp enum_rxns
How to run:        ./enum_rxns

The following files are REQUIRED to run this program:

(1)  "contrib1_ext_322.dat" and "contrib2_ext_322.dat" contain the free energy
      contributions from individual groups and group-group interactions respectively,
      allowing free energies of formation of each compound to be calculated.
      These files have been generated by Bartek's Mathematica notebook, 
      "automatic_group_contr_calc.nb".

(2)  "reactions_types_v3_2_2.txt" contains human readable string representations
      of the reaction types included in the network and their EC class.

(3)  "names_322.txt" is a manually created file with chemical formulae and names.
      The second name entry is that used in Alberty's database.

(4)  "replace_dG_322.dat" contains the experimentally determined free energy of formation 
      for the compounds (given by formula) in Alberty's database.



The following files are CREATED by the program:

(1)  "compounds_list__4C_v3_2_2_ext_100.dat" is the full list of compounds in the network.
     Entriess are: index, free energy of formation, formula, name, charge.

(2)  "reactions__4C_v3_2_2_ext_100.dat" is full list of reactions in network. 
     Entries are: reaction type, substrate index, product index, ATP consumed, NADH produced, 
                 standard free energy fo reaction, reaction string.

(3)  "groups__4C_v3_2_2_ext_100.dat" contains the chemical groups and their palindrome
     
(4)  "reaction_patterns_322.txt" is an expanded version of the reaction types read in from
      reaction_types input file. It is this automatically created file that the program uses 
      to generate reactions.
      IT IS GENERATED BY:

(5)  "pajek..." was used for visualization; no longer used.

General procedure of code:







#######################################################################################



Known bugs:

(1)  Code does not always successfully remove duplicate reaction entries
      - fix manually by:   sort -n "file_in" | uniq > "file_out" 

(2)  Duplicated isomerization reactions where "X > Y" and "Y > X" as 2 
     separate entries.

Some notes for altering program:

- If you want to alter length of compounds, change "cmax" variable in main() method

- To alter pH, need to be careful to do two things:
   (i)  change pH variable in the mathematica notebook and generate new
        "contrib1_ext_322.dat" and "contrib2_ext_322.dat" files
   (ii) At about line 540 in enum_reactions_v3_2_2.cpp the free energy of formation
        for the external metabolites has been entered by hand - these are for a 
        specified pH and ionic strength and must also be updated.
