This directory contains the code to perform the pathway comparison based on Heinrich1997 'perfect enzyme' calculation.

Two separate programs:

  (1)  ComparePaths_perfectEnzyme.java assumes a flat enzyme distribution
  (2)  ComparePaths_EnzymeOptimization.java calls Powell's optimization to find distribution of enzymes that 
       maximizes pathway flux


- PerfectEnzyme.java hold the flux calculation
- PowellOptimization_relativeTolerance.java holds method to optimize enzyme distribution so as to maximize flux
- Programs use "Reaction" object in Reaction.java in the flux calculations but previous code used "Reactions3.java" - I have currently implemented a quick fix that just converts these objects (Convert_Reactions3_to_Reaction.java) rather than changing the format of the input and output files.




Notes on how to run:

Parameters that are hard-coded in the programs and must be chosen before running the comparison: NUMBERSETS = number of times we sample the parameter space;  conc_min and conc_max = restrictions on feasible steady state intermediate metabolite concentrations;  all min and max values we sample between for each parameter (external metabolite).  (The totalEnzyme and diffusion rate constant 'kd' are also set in here but do not affect the outcome of the comparison). 

Program requires an input file listing the pathways to be compared, "inputPaths.paths", in the format generated by the pathway enumeration. With this, run in terminal:

  "java ComparePaths_perfectEnzyme inputPaths.paths out_filename &"

where out_filename is where the comparison output will be printed. If steady state concentrations fall outside the allowed range, the flux of the pathway is set to -1.0; it is deemed infeasible. 

It can take a while to run the comparison when the enzyme distribution is being optimized, so you can run this code multiple times but for a smaller number of parameter samples, and send the output of each to separate files. You can then simply combine these files using the 'combineOutput_allButFirstAndLast.sh' script found in previous directory.
